THE JOURNEY TO THE WEST REVISED FROM OREGON 1978


The Journey to the West BASIC game is a hack version of the well-known Oregon Trail' 
as Printed in the May/June 1978 Edition of Creative Computing Magazine.


Instead of the original five items one may purchase for the trip,
Oxen, Food, Ammunition, Clothing, and Miscellaneous Supplies,
Journey to the West has an altered version considering the vastly different background:


"More Horse and Wagon" is replacing Oxen, as one of the crucial member on the journey
is already the Bailong Horse, who is responsible for solid transportation.
More tools will definitely speed up one's trip, however.


"Food" remains the same.


"Alms bowls and dharma" are functioning because a devoted buddhist practioner 
like Tripitaka would most likely chastise the baleful violence of "Ammunition". 


"Robes" replaced "Clothing" and "Miscellaneous Supplies" are changed to 
"Elixir and Jade Jar" for the more specific setting in Journey to the West.


The diffuclty level are determined by how devoted a buddist practioner one is instead
of ones gun finesse. The gun shot sounds are, then, replaced with 
"AMITABHA","MERCY","WUKONG", and"KINYA" -- all more appropriate to the story.


The player will also experience difficulties and attacks that follows the story better.
